    <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
    <section id="about-project">
        <h2>About T-Real</h2>
        <p>
            T-Real is a simple time-reality calculator designed to expose a problem most of us face every day —
            <strong>we underestimate how long things actually take</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether it’s studying, building a project, or learning a new skill, optimism bias often leads us to
            unrealistic timelines. T-Real exists as a <strong>sanity check</strong>, not a complex project
            management tool.
        </p>

        <p>
            You enter what you think a task will take, how much time you realistically have, and whether
            interruptions exist. T-Real then shows a more grounded, realistic completion timeline — helping you
            plan better and reduce frustration.

    <!-- HOW IT IS BUILT -->
    <section id="about-tech">
        <h2>How It’s Built</h2>
        <p>
            T-Real is built entirely using core web technologies:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML</strong> for clean, semantic structure</li>
            <li><strong>CSS</strong> for a modern, visually appealing, and responsive design</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> for handling user input, calculations, and dynamic results</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            No frameworks, no APIs, no external dependencies — just strong fundamentals.
            The goal was to keep the product fast, accessible, and easy to understand.
        </p>

    <!-- ABOUT YOU -->
    <section id="about-me">
        <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m <strong>Aditee Jha</strong>, a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong interest in
            problem-solving, systems thinking, and building tools that are simple yet meaningful.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m currently focused on strengthening my foundations in
            <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms (Java)</strong> and
            <strong>Web Development</strong>. T-Real is one of my early projects where I intentionally
            avoided overengineering and focused on clarity, logic, and user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of coding, I’m an active writer and public speaker, with experience in debating,
            oratory, and reflective writing. That perspective strongly influences how I think about
            usability and clarity — both in code and in design.
        </p>

        <p>
            T-Real represents my belief that good software doesn’t have to be complex — it has to be honest.
